In summary:
## Data Download and Extraction:
- The notebook includes code to connect to download zip files containing the dataset from Google Cloud Storage.
- NB: If you have correct credentials to access the bucket, you can connect to Google Cloud Storage and download files.
- Extract the downloaded file for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Load the extracted dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Handle missing values, clean noisy data, and ensure data is in the correct format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize patterns in the data using matplotlib.
- Calculate basic statistics to understand distributions and relationships.

## Model Building:
- Use regression or clustering techniques (e.g., KMeans, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor) as specified in the notebook.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for validation.

## Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).

## Forecasting:
- Implement time series forecasting using ARIMA for trend prediction.
- Visualize predictions versus historical values to assess reliability.

## Generate Final Output:
- Save the processed data or model outputs as required.

# Notes
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
- Modify the notebook as needed to suit additional requirements.
