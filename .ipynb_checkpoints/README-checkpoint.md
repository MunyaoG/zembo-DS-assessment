# Structure
## Notebook: code-for-DS-assessment.ipynb
Contains all the analysis and code required for the task.
Environment: Python, Jupyter Notebook
Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project: from google.cloud import storage, from pandas.errors import ParserError, EmptyDataError (for catching errors while trying to read CSV files), from scipy.stats import linregress, from sklearn.cluster import KMeans, from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor, from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as mse, from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor, from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA, from zipfile import ZipFile (for working with zipped files), import csv (for working with CSV datasets), import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, import numpy as np, import os (for working with directories and saving/accessing locally), import pandas as pd, import requests (for accessing online data), and import warnings (for clean code and output).

How to Run
Install the required dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebook in Jupyter:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook code-for-DS-assessment.ipynb
Usage
Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate the required results.
Follow these steps to execute the notebook:

Data Download and Extraction:

The notebook includes code to connect to Google Cloud Storage and download a zip file containing the dataset.
Ensure you have the correct credentials to access the bucket.
Extract the downloaded file for further analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Load the extracted dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Handle missing values, clean noisy data, and ensure data is in the correct format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize trends and patterns in the data using matplotlib or similar libraries.
Calculate basic statistics to understand distributions and relationships.
Model Building:

Use regression or clustering techniques (e.g., KMeans, GradientBoostingRegressor) as specified in the notebook.
Split the data into training and testing sets for validation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
Visualize predictions versus actual values to assess accuracy.
Forecasting (Optional):

Implement time series forecasting using ARIMA or similar models for trend prediction.
Generate Final Output:

Save the processed data or model outputs as required.

Notes
Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
Modify the notebook as needed to suit additional requirements.
